This repository contains the source code for a Smart Checkout System designed to revolutionize the shopping experience at supermarkets. The system consists of a web application deployed on a Tomcat server, an Android app for customers, and integration with hardware components such as cameras and Arduino for gate control.

# Features
Product and Trolley Management: 
Administrators can add, update, and delete products and trolleys from the database through the web application.

Gate Control Mode: 
The system includes a gate control mode where cameras scan QR codes on trolleys approaching the exit. If the trolley's bill is paid, the gate opens automatically; otherwise, a message prompts the user to pay.

Customer Android App: 
Customers can scan their trolley's QR code upon entering the mart and update their trolley's status to "billing." As they shop, they can scan product QR codes to add items to their bill. Upon completing their shopping, they can pay the bill online, view and save the receipt, and update the trolley's status to "paid."

# Technologies Used
Web Application: 
Java, Servlets, JSP, HTML, CSS, JavaScript Android App: Java, Firebase Realtime Database, QR Code Scanner Gate Control: Arduino, Servo Motor, Camera Integration
